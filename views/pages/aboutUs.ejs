        <h1>Why do we exist?</h1>
        <p>
            The construction industry is one of the highest-risk industries for modern slavery due to its
            complex, opaque supply chains, reliance on low-wage labour, and global sourcing of
            materials. Labour exploitation and modern slavery can occur at any stage, from raw material
            extraction to manufacturing and site labour. These conditions are often hidden behind
            subcontracting, limited oversight, and poor transparency and traceability of the material
            value chains. Without traceable data, it is difficult to identify and redress these human rights
            harms.
        </p>
    
        <h1>Human Rights, The forgotten Loop in the Circular Economy.</h1>        
        <p>
            Reusing materials isn&#39;t just about reducing waste or carbon footprints. It&#39;s about preserving
            the human stories behind them. Every product, reused or not, carries a social history and
            human legacy. When that history reflects fair work and ethical sourcing, reuse becomes an
            act of respect and value creation. Through a circular lens, supply chains and site labour are
            not separate systems. They form one continuous value chain that shapes the life of a
            material from extraction to production to installation and to reuse.
        </p>
        <p>
            OpenArchitecture helps surface the social stories behind materials and reveal the continuity
            of the value chain&#39;s social history. This enables ACE professionals to make material choices
            that honour both people and materials at every stage and to reuse with confidence in their
            human rights legacy. By tracing the social provenance of materials and linking them to reuse
            decisions in building design, the OpenArchitecture project demonstrates how circular
            practices can uphold and extend human rights across the built environment.

        Curtin University has approved ethics HREC
        XXXXXXXX for this research project
        <p>
            Modern slavery remains a hidden risk in
            architecture, engineering and construction, often
            embedded deep within material and labour supply
            chains. This project investigates how digital
            technologies, like blockchain and traceability
            platforms, can help surface that risk and support
            more ethical, informed choices. 
        </p>

            OpenArchitecture is part of a long-term research study that started back in 2022 to
            understand and make the social impacts of materials visible in architectural design,
            procurement, and construction. By taking our survey, you’re helping us better understand
            how AEC professionals engage with modern slavery risks and how we can build tools to
            support due diligence for human rights in AEC practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            By completing our survey you are supporting
            our research efforts to combat modern
            slavery in our built environment.

        <h1>Beta Testing Phase</h1>
        <p>
            <i>OpenArchitecture</i> is currently in its testing phase.
            We're piloting the platform on a live construction
            project The Legacy Living Lab (L3), a modular
            and circular building in Perth, to track the social
            provenance of selected materials in real-time. This
            trial will help us refine the platform’s features,
            improve usability, and ensure it delivers meaningful
            insights for AEC Industry professionals committed
            to ethical sourcing for human rights.

        <h1>How does this blockchain work?</h1>
        <p>
            <i>OpenArchitecture</i> connects directly to a
            product’s blockchain cache. Each cache
            stores verified supply chain and modern
            slavery data, indexed for quick retrieval on
            this website. By linking to these caches, the
            platform makes it easy to search, view, and
            compare the social provenance of materials,
            without needing the technical expertise to
            navigate the blockchain itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Materials listed on <i>OpenArchitecture</i> are
            linked to Hyperledger Fabric, a secure,
            permissioned blockchain designed for
            transparency and trust. Each material entry
            is connected to a verified data record on the
            ledger, capturing key supply chain events
            and social compliance information. This
            ensures the provenance of materials can be
            traced reliably from source to site or as far
            as the information trail leads! 
        </p>
        <h1>Why Blockchain?</h1>
        <p>
            Blockchain provides an immutable, transparent,
            and secure way to track the journey of materials
            throughout the supply chain. By using blockchain,
            <i>OpenArchitecture</i> ensures that every piece of data,
            from sourcing to end-use, cannot be altered,
            providing a trusted record of a material's social and
            environmental history. This technology enables a
            new level of traceability and accountability, helping
            to protect human rights and ensure ethical
            practices across the construction industry.
